# aocelm2021

Advent of Code 2021 in Elm Lang.

## Install

This project uses Elm 19. To run it, install that first.

For optional development packages for formatting and testing, install:

```
npm install -g elm-test elm-format
```

## Running

Note: The day to run is hard-coded in Makefile.
```
make
open index.html
```

And I develop, I just run `make` and once everything compiles, I refresh index.html in my browser.

## Formatting

```
make fmt
```

## Tests

```
make test
```
