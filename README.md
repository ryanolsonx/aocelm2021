# aocelm2021

Advent of Code 2021 in Elm Lang.

## Install

This project uses Elm 19. To run it, install that first.

For optional development packages for formatting and testing, install:

```
npm install -g elm-test elm-format onchange
```

## Running

Note: The day to run is hard-coded in Makefile.
```
make
```

And I develop, I use `make wbuild` to auto build/run Elm and `make wfmt` to auto format on save of files.
